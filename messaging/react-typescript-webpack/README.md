   1. Copy public key and in `src/configuration.ts` file replace `<YOUR_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY_HERE>` with your key.
   1. Under the **General** tab, find your Web App or create a new one, copy the Firebase Config object that corresponds to your app, and replace the config object in `src/configuration.ts` with the object you copied.
1. Build and run the example.
   1. On the command line run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   1. Run `npm run serve` to serve a development build.
   1. Click **Request Permission** button to request permission for the app to send notifications to the browser.
